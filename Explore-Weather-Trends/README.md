### Compare local with global temperature trends

This analysis is part of the first project of the Data Analyst Nanodegree on Udacity.
The SQL Database was provided by Udacity. In this repo you will find the extracted csvs for the analysis.

For this project I used SQL to extract data from a database and saved the results as csvs, used pandas to read the data into a DataFrame and visualized it with matplotlib. The visualization contains some explanatory annotations.

Here are my conclusions, comparing temperatures from Munich, Germany to global temperatures:
1. the general trend is the same between Munich and the World, but there are more fluctuations in Munich
2. the global temperature is about 4 degrees warmer (looking at the mean, max and min of each plot)
3. the global temperature has a more clear upward trend after approx. 1840
4. the spike around 1950 is the first to break previous temperature highs in Munich
5. you can see an accelerated temperature raising from apporx. 1975 in global temperatures and from approx. 1985 in Munich
